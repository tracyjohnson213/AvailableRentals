# Available Rentals

This is a student project for COSP230 Android App Development in Java at Long Beach City College.  The intent is to demonstrate knowledge of concepts required to develop an Android application.

# UX

I have created a mockup of the application (../Available Rentals Mockup.bmpr) for a rental property managment company
- to display 5 available rentals
- to display a featured rental on a splash screen
- to allow users to view a grid of photos of available rentals
- to allow users to view an enlarged selected photo from those displayed in grid of available rentals
- to allow users to select a property from a list of available rentals
- to allow users to view additional photos of a selected rental
- to allow users to filter rental by criteria
- to allow users to input into a form to request a viewing of a rental
- to allow users to input into a form to request additional information from the property managment company
- to allow users to play and pause a video about the property management company
